I tried to help today by analyzing the pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys that participants filled out for different workshops provided by Starting With Today. I haven't provided much by way of results because there are some limitations with this data:

1. I only had post-workshop surveys for 2014, and only for some of the workshops that Starting With Today had hosted. This means it wasn't possible to examine how participants ratings changed over time, as I only had data for one year.

2. I only had pre-workshop surveys for three years, all of which are pretty out of date. In addition, almost all of the workshops were only offered once, which makes it difficult to analyze trends in participation over time.

3. The overall amount of responses was very smallâ€”it's very quick to just read all of the post-event feedback one by one and almost all of it is strongly positive, which means that detailed data analysis isn't really necessary here.

In light of these limitations, I've produced the following outputs:

1. `average_workshop_ratings_2014.csv` shows the average rating provided for the three types of workshops from 2014 with post-workshop surveys available: the budget workshop, the dream building workshop, and the resume workshop. All three workshops received very high ratings overall, but the resume workshop rating was the highest and the budget workshop received the lowest ratings.

2. `participants_by_workshop_2014-2016.png` shows the total number of participants in each type of workshop for which there is pre-workshop survey data available, and, if the workshop was offered in multiple years, the breakdown of participants from each year. It's really important to emphasize that this is only three years of data from six years ago, so I would not make any claims about the success of any of these workshops based on this data.

3. `participants_by_gender_2015-2016.png` shows the breakdown of workshop participants based on their reported gender, for each workshop type and **for 2015 and 2016 only**. The pre-workshop survey in 2014 did not ask participants to report their gender, so there is no data from that year. The general takeaway is that a significant majority of participants seem to be women, but again, this data is six years out of date and is very likely no longer reflective of reality. 

In addition, I have added the file `pre_workshop_surveys_2014-2016_cleaned.csv` to the Google Drive folder "Volunteer Augmented Data". This file takes the three datasets of pre-workshop surveys from 2014, 2015, and 2016, makes them a bit more uniform, and combines them into one dataset. Hopefully this can be helpful as a more standard way to collect and save data for future years!
